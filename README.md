# Goal: Live Streaming Using Pi
The Goal is to build live video streaming application using Raspberry Pi and its Camera Module.

## Getting Started with Raspberry Pi
We will cover what ever you need to setup and all the basic steps to follow when getting started with Raspberry Pi for the very 1st time. 

## What do you need?
- A Raspberry Pi board. For this tutorial I have Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with built-in WIFI and Bluetooth.
- Official Raspberry Pi Camera V2 Module. For this tutorial I ordered 'Sony IMX219 Light-sensitive Chips 8MP Pixels 1080P Video Original RPI 3 Camera'
- Acrylic case transparent Shell cover with Cooling Fan (Optional - just to prevent your circuit from getting heat up)
- Micro sdcard for storage
- Power adapter or usb cable to power up your Raspberry Pi
